  <div class="story">A few years ago I started to lose interest in activities I loved like painting, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. Until I eventually lost interest in pretty much everything. Nothing brought me happiness. Nothing was fun anymore. Then I realized that I didn't feel any emotion really. I wasn't sad, or angry. It seemed like all I could feel was tired. I started to think back to if something major had happened that would cause me to lose interest and essentially feel numb to everything. I spent days, then weeks that turned into months where I was retracing my steps to try and recall if something awful had occured that maybe I had blocked out. Nothing had happened. I was just numb, but why? Not knowing why I was in this state of emotional numbness was deblitating.</div>
