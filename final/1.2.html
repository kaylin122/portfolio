  <div class="story"><p>A few years ago I started to lose interest in activities I loved like painting, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. Until I eventually lost interest in pretty much everything. Nothing brought me happiness. Nothing was fun anymore. Then I realized that I didn't feel any emotion really. I wasn't sad, or angry. It seemed like all I could feel was tired.</p></div>
